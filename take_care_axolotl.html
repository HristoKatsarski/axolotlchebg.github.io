                In this Axolotl care sheet, we will cover the ideal tank size, tank mates, temperature, lighting,<br> 
                water parameters, diet and more, to give you everything you need to get started with your new Axolotl habitat.
            </p>

            <p>NOTE: This care sheet was NOT written by us, but was rather taken from a Axolotl.org.</p>

        <div class="axolotl_housing">
            <h>Axolotl housing and tank mates</h>
            
            <p>
                Axolotls generally grow to around 20-30cm (8-12"), although specimens of up to 45cm (18")<br> 
                have been recorded. Therefore, despite not being particularly active pets, they do require <br>
                an enclosure with a good amount of space, especially if you're adding other Axolotls as tank mates.<br>
                <br>

                The footprint of an Axolotl tank should take priority over <br>
                the water volume. We recommend a 90cm aquarium for a <br>
                single adult, or a 120cm (4ft) aquarium for a pair of <br>
                fully grown adult Axolotls. Young Axolotls can be housed<br> 
                in a smaller 60cm (2ft) aquarium, but this would need to be <br>
                upgraded as the Axolotl reached maturity.<br>
                <br>
                A new Axolotl tank should be treated in the same way as a <br>
                new aquarium for fish, and should be cycled with ammonia <br>
                for 6 to 8 weeks before introducing your new Axolotl, <br>
                regularly testing the water until the ammonia and nitrites <br>
                consistently remain at 0ppm, and you can begin to see the <br>
                presence of nitrates - this means your filter is fully cycled <br>
                and colonised by beneficial nitrifying bacteria.</p>

        <div class="axolotl_ltw">
            <h>Axolotl lighting, temperature and water flow</h>
            <p>
                Axolotls, unlike many terrestrial amphibians, do not require any specific lighting.<br>
                A standard aquarium light to provide a day/night cycle will suffice, although they <br>
                don't tend to like too much bright light, so it is best to keep it on a lower setting.<br>
                <br>
                The ideal water temperature for an Axolotl aquarium is between 15-18°C (59-64°C), which <br>
                that in most instances, no heater is required. Most aquariums will come as a full kit, <br>
                and already include a heater, in which case, it is worth keeping hold of in the event of <br>
                a drastic temperature drop that may bring the water temperature lower than optimum.<br>
                <br>
                Axolotls are very sensitive to poor water quality, and can make for quite messy pets. <br>
                It is, therefore, a particularly important part of Axolotl care to provide adequate <br>
                filtration to your Axolotl's tank.<br>
                <br>
                Again, most aquariums are sold as kits and will come either with a drip filter system <br>
                installed or with their own internal or external filter, which will already be rated <br>
                for the water volume of the tank, although it is important to ensure the water flow <br>
                remains steady and not too high, as Axolotls do not enjoy a strong water flow.
            </p>

        <div class="axolotl_diet" id="ad">
            <h>Axolotl Diet</h>
            <p>
                Axolotls feed primarily on animal material, which means they are carnivores, <br>
                possessing poor eyesight but a keen sense of smell. They should be fed a varied <br>
                diet of Axolotl pellets, large earthworms, bloodworm and other commercially available <br>
                frozen fish foods, such as cockles and mussels. It is important to remove any uneaten <br>
                food fairly quickly, as when the food is left in for too long, it can have a detrimental <br>
                effect on your water parameters.
